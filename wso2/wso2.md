### WSO2. API Manager
* Use case - you have a lot of servers with APIs and a lot of systems that use those APIs.
* Built on top of OSGI framework `Carbon` (modular architecture, where application = bunch of jar files)
* API Manager components:
    * `API Publisher` - publish API, monetize, limit rates
    * `API Developer Portal` - app store for apis
        * Allows publishers to advertise their APIs
        * Allows consumers to discover, evaluate and consume APIs
    * `Service Catalog` - devs can register their services in a RESTful manner
* Documentation:
    * [API Manager 4.2.0](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/4.2.0/)
    * [Architecture](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/get-started/apim-architecture/)
